# Contributing to Level Up
As we build out Level Up, there will be numerous different ways to contribute. If you're interested in making a code or content contribution, please start by creating an issue and discussing the idea with a member of our team in the Level Up Telegram group. We are thrilled to support you!

The most impactful contributions you can make right now are:
### Creating a coding challenge on the Level Up website
1. To create a new coding challenge, ensure that the challenge follows the [Challenge specifications](https://scrollzkp.notion.site/Level-Up-Challenge-Specifications-95da29d76e4140089f8d771ce09e6c30#13d77338ed8d491982d01eb873abbbe3)
2. Take a look at our [website](https://www.levelupweb3.xyz/solidity/data-types) and [codebase](src/challenges/solidity) to get a feeling for how it should look like
3. Create an issue following the standards and processes below

We try to keep a clean commit history, so we'll follow a standard process:
- Create a new issue
    - Comment on the issue if you'd like to be assigned to it
- Fork the Repo & Create a PR
    - If your PR contains multiple commits, we'll ask you to squash them
    - If your PR has conflicts, we'll ask you to rebase it
- Someone will review your PR
- Your PR will be merged, amended, closed, or you'll be asked for changes

## Standards

- Commit messages
    - Start with a present-tense verb
    - Keep your commit headline short but sufficient to understand the scope and focus of the change.
    - Changes are often formatted like `add doc X`, `fix page Y`, `improve docs for Z`.
    - Example: "update contract addresses for USDC on Scroll Sepolia".
- If you touch any infrastructure, make sure it builds with ```yarn build```
- Trust the autoformatter (prettier)
- Make sure images are optimized and compressed
- Keep images < 20kb whenever possible to keep the site fast and the repo small (try trimage)

## How to rebase a PR
```git fetch
git rebase origin/main
# resolve conflicts
git push -f
```

It's okay to force push over your own PR branch. That's what we want so that the commits are clean.

## How to squash a PR

To squash multiple commits, use the following steps:

### 1. Rebase multiple commits into one

When squashing commits, you should always rebase from the main branch of the repo: `git rebase -i origin/main`.

After rebasing, you can squash the commits by changing `pick` into `squash` for all of your commits except the recent one:

```shell
pick 686e386 add doc structure
squash ee2eed7 add main content
squash 3eccd39 fix typos

# Rebase 287bc79..3eccd39 onto 287bc79 (3 commands)
# â€¦
```

### 2. Fix your commit message

Next, comment or remove all of your commit messages and leave the one that describes your PR.

### 3. Force push to your branch

Lastly, force push the changes to your branch to have a clean history:

```shell
git push -f
```

It's easier to use `git --amend` while working on your PR first. Avoiding multiple commits is much cleaner and easier than fixing them.

## Checking Links

To check the site for broken links, run `npm run linkcheck`.

## Adding or updating code samples

The main code samples are stored in the `/public/samples/` directory.

## Style Guide

- **Bold** key terms or any terms the user must absolutely know when reading a doc.
- _Italicize_ terms for emphasis but only when necessary.
- When referring to dropdown menus or a sequence of dropdown events, bold the relevant entities. Example: Go to **Menu Name** > **Option**. Do not use quotes.
- Use markdown over HTML wherever possible.
- When writing an additional note, start it with **Note:**.
- Use a consistent voice.
