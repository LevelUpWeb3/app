What was once speculation is now a reality: AI and blockchain are technologies with lots of synergy. Recently, AI agents have been actively participating in social media and on-chain, performing tasks like tipping users, swapping on-chain and more.

However, a critical problem remains: the current meta of AI agents lacks verifiability. This means the creator or owner of an AI agent can potentially tamper or impersonate the AI model, so users can't know what was done by the AI or by the creator. In this tutorial, we’ll explore how Zero Knowledge, shortened as ZK, can provide the most secure and seamless experience for everyone in the AI agent space.

### Why Zero Knowledge?

Zero Knowledge, provides two distinct capabilities: privacy and scalability.

For this particular case, we’ll focus on the second one. It's currently impossible to verify on-chain the computation of a Machine Learning (ML) model by normal means because it's too expensive and in most cases won't even fit in a an Ethereum block. Instead, we’ll compute the ML model off-chain and use ZK to generate a proof of that computation. This proof can then be verified cheaply on-chain by a Solidity smart contract, ensuring trust without requiring full on-chain execution.

## Building a Verifiable Tipper AI Agent

In this article we’ll create a Tipper AI agent that is able to decide who to send a tip to based on data provided that can be, for example, a list of comments on farcaster. We will need to create a smart contract that acts as a guardrail, ensuring the AI agent operates autonomously without being controlled by the creator. In order to achieve this, we’ll use [EZKL](https://ezkl.xyz/), a tool for generating verifiable proofs of ML computations.

1. Create a ZKML Verifier Contract
1. Generate a valid ZK Proof
1. Launch a simple Tip Token
1. Tip users when a valid ZK proof is submitted

### EZKL: ZKML library for developers

EZKL provides convenient Google Colab notebooks to help you get started quickly. Here’s the [Simple Demo Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/zkonduit/ezkl/blob/main/examples/notebooks/simple_demo_all_public.ipynb).

[![Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/zkonduit/ezkl/blob/main/examples/notebooks/simple_demo_all_public.ipynb)

## Step 0: Generate an AI model

A model can, for example, decide who deserves a tip based who has the best comments on Farcaster, buy a token based on market conditions, or [mint an NFT based on your singing skills](https://cryptoidol.tech/). There are endless possibilities in terms of what an AI model can do on-chain.

In this example we'll keep it simple, we'll generate a model that just decides who deserves a `1000` token tip deterministically to an address provided.

Let's start by replacing the first block provided in Google Colab with the following. Also, replace `tip_recipient_address` with a wallet of your choice, this wallet will receive the tokens tipped by the AI.

```python
# Check if notebook is in Colab
try:
    # Install ezkl and onnx if in Colab
    import google.colab
    import subprocess
    import sys
    subprocess.check_call([sys.executable, "-m", "pip", "install", "ezkl"])
    subprocess.check_call([sys.executable, "-m", "pip", "install", "onnx"])
except:
    pass  # Rely on local installation of ezkl otherwise

# Import required libraries
from torch import nn
import torch
import os
import ezkl

# Define the address that will receive the tip
tip_recipient_address = 0x707e55a12557E89915D121932F83dEeEf09E5d70

# Convert the address to the format expected by EZKL
def address_to_byte_tensor(address):
    address_hex = f"{address:040x}"
    return torch.tensor([int(address_hex[i:i+2], 16) for i in range(0, len(address_hex), 2)], dtype=torch.uint8)

tip_recipient_tensor = address_to_byte_tensor(tip_recipient_address)
print(f"Tip Recipient Tensor: {tip_recipient_tensor}")

# Define a model that outputs the tipped address
class FixedHexAddressModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, address_tensor):
        super(FixedHexAddressModel, self).__init__()
        self.output_value = address_tensor

    def forward(self, x):
        # Ignore input and always return the fixed address
        batch_size = x.size(0)
        return self.output_value.repeat(batch_size, 1)  # Repeat for batch size

# Instantiate the model
circuit = FixedHexAddressModel(tip_recipient_tensor)

# Example input
dummy_input = torch.ones(1, 1)  # Dummy input (not used by the model)

# Generate the output
output = circuit(dummy_input)
print(f"Output (Hex Address): {output}")

# Export the model to ONNX format
torch.onnx.export(
    circuit,
    dummy_input,
    "fixed_hex_address_model.onnx",
    input_names=["input"],
    output_names=["output"],
    dynamic_axes={"input": {0: "batch_size"}, "output": {0: "batch_size"}}
)

print("Model saved as 'fixed_hex_address_model.onnx'!")
```

## Step 1: Create a Verifier Contract

Next, run all the other code snippets in Google Colab, this will generate a ZK circuit that is verifiable off-chain. Now we want to be able to verify on-chain, to do it run the following snippet. This will print a fully working Solidity verifier contract.

```python
# Define the file where ABI and Solidity code will be generated
abi_path = 'test.abi'
sol_code_path = 'test.sol'

# Creates Solidity verifier code based on the circuit previously generated
res = await ezkl.create_evm_verifier(
        vk_path,
        
        settings_path,
        sol_code_path,
        abi_path,
    )

assert res == True

# Print the solidity code on the console
with open(sol_code_path, 'r') as sol_file:
    sol_content = sol_file.read()
    print(sol_content)
```

The next step is deploying to your preferred chain. **Please note that compiler optimizations must be enabled to successfully compile the contract.** This is necessary because the generated contract is quite large and requires optimization to fit within deployment constraints.

## Step 2: Generate a ZK Proof

Next, generate the ZK proof and encode it in the format that is expected by the verifier contract.

Run the following snippet and the proof will be printed.

```python
# Define where the calldata in json format will be generated
calldata = 'calldata.proof'

# Encodes the proof in the format expected by the verifier smart contract
res = ezkl.encode_evm_calldata(
        proof_path,
        calldata,
    )

# Optionally, print the the JSON data
# print(res)

# Convert the proof from json format to hexadecimal bytes
calldata_hex = "0x" + ''.join(f"{byte:02x}" for byte in res)
print(calldata_hex)
```

EZKL generates a ZK proofs as raw calldata sent to the Verifier contract. This means that the proof must be sent using a low level evm `CALL` function instead of how you normally call another smart contract in solidity, more about this in Step 4.

## Step 3. Launch the Tip Token

Deploy a simple ERC20 token that the AI agent will be able to interact with. Deploy the following contract that will mint some tokens to you.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
// Compatible with OpenZeppelin Contracts ^5.0.0
pragma solidity ^0.8.22;

import {ERC20} from "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";

// Simple ERC20 token contract created from the OpenZeppelin Wizzard
contract MyToken is ERC20 {
    constructor() ERC20("Tip Token", "TIPT") {
        // Mint 21M tokens to the deployer
        _mint(msg.sender, 21_000_000 ether);
    }
}
```

## Step 4: Build the Tipper Contract

The Tipper contract ensures that tokens are distributed only when a valid ZK proof is submitted. Deploy the following contract by replacing the `HALO2_VERIFIER` and `TIP_TOKEN` with the contract addresses you just deployed. Then, transfer at least `1000` Tip Tokens to this contract.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0

pragma solidity >=0.7.0 <0.9.0;

// Interface that contains the function that verifies the proof on the Halo2 verifier generated automatically by EZKL
interface Halo2Verifier {
    function verifyProof(bytes calldata proof, uint256[] calldata instances) external view;
}

// On this example we will just use the transfer function on the Tip Token for sending 1000 tokens when a valid proof is submitted
interface IERC20 {
    function transfer(address to, uint256 value) external returns (bool);
}

// The Tipper contract acts as a guardrail for the AI agent, only allows to perform an action is a valid ZKML proof was submitted
contract Tipper {
    // Replace the following two address with the two contracts you just deployed
    address HALO2_VERIFIER = 0x84fBBc680F4aB4240e8cF6C488aEca03bfF91d2E;
    address TIP_TOKEN = 0x84fBBc680F4aB4240e8cF6C488aEca03bfF91d2E;

    // Sends the tip to the user only if a valid ZKML proof is submitted
    function verifyAndSendTip(bytes memory proofCalldata) public {
        // Verification is done passing the calldata bytes we previously generated to the Halo2 verifier contract
        (bool success, bytes memory data) = HALO2_VERIFIER.call(proofCalldata);
        // The EZKL verifier returns 1 if the proof is valid
        if(success && data.length == 32 && uint8(data[31]) == 1)
            // Transfer 1000 tokens to the user
            // Notice sensitive parameters such as the recipient, have to be generated by the ZK proof to prevent frontrun attacks
            IERC20(TIP_TOKEN).transfer(extractTipRecipientFromProof(proofCalldata), 1_000 ether);
        else 
            revert("Could not verify proof");
    }

    // The ZK proofs have public parameters baked into to the proof
    // In this case, we extract the tip recipient address from the proof and convert it into a Solidity address format
    function extractTipRecipientFromProof(bytes memory proofCalldata) internal pure returns (address) {
        bytes memory lastBytes = new bytes(20);
        for (uint i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
            lastBytes[20-1-i] = proofCalldata[proofCalldata.length - (1+i*32)];
        }
        return address(bytes20(abi.encodePacked(lastBytes)));
    }
}
```

Now call `verifyAndSendTip` by submitting the proof as parameter in the calldata format and once the transaction is confirmed `1000` tokens will be awarded to the tip recipient.
