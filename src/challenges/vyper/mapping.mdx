# Mapping

Mappings are data structures known has [hash tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table), that associate keys with values. They are declared as `HashMap[KeyType, ValueType]`.

To look up a mapping value, you will need to use the `keccak256` hash of the key data.

Note that mappings can only be declared as state variables.

```python
# pragma version 0.4.0

# Notice you will need to define mapping variable using `HashMap` keyword
mapping_example: HashMap[uint256, String[100]]

# Example below maps key value "1" to "Hello, World!"
@external
def set_mapping_pair():
    self.mapping_example[1] = "Hello, World!"

# Pass argument of "1" to deployed function below to view response
@external
@view
def get_mapping_value(x: uint256) -> String[100]:
    return self.mapping_example[x]
```
