# Immutable

Immutable variables are similar to constants, except the value must be defined in the constructor of the contract. Declare `immutable` variables if you want a variable to remain constant throughout the lifetime of a deployed contract.

Accessing an immutable variable reduces runtime gas costs in comparison with `constant` variables.

```python
# pragma version 0.4.0

IMMUTABLE_INT: immutable(uint256)
IMMUTABLE_ADDR: immutable(address)

@deploy
def __init__():
    IMMUTABLE_INT = 999
    IMMUTABLE_ADDR = 0xE2b4795039517653c5Ae8C2A9BFdd783b48f447A

@external
@view
def retrieveImmutables() -> (uint256, address):
    return (IMMUTABLE_INT, IMMUTABLE_ADDR)
```
