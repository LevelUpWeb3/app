# Get Started with Sindri

Welcome to level 1 of the Sindri mission by Level Up!

Sindri Labs' API provides simple access to hardware acceleration for zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) generation, making ZKP generation easier by transforming complex infrastructure into simple API calls. In this mission, you'll learn how to use Sindri's API for ZKP generation.

## High Level Structure

1. **GitHub Repository:** Begin by exploring the GitHub repository and README.
2. **Guide:** Proceed to the guide where you will find instructions on getting started with Sindri, including installation, authentication, and usage of the Sindri CLI and Python SDK.

## Mission

1. Visit the Sindri documentation to understand the services and capabilities provided by Sindri Labs' API.
2. Follow the guide to learn how to install the Sindri CLI, authenticate and log in, compile and deploy circuits, and use the Sindri Python SDK to prove circuits.
3. Execute the provided Python script to run your first proof on Sindri.

Complete the mission to level up your skills with zero-knowledge proofs and leverage Sindri's API for secure and efficient ZKP generation!
