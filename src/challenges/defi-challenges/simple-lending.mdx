# Simple Lending

If you haven't completed the Token Swap challenge yet, check it out [here](https://www.levelup.xyz/challenges/simple-token-swap)!

Let's take a step further and dive into another core DeFi primitive, lending. Aave is one of the top protocols, securing billions in assets. Let's learn how to earn yield by lending through smart contracts.

In this challenge, you'll implement a contract that deposits into Aave pools on your behalf. You'll also be able to withdraw your supplied tokens along with the earned rewards.

## Objective

Your task is to:
1. Develop your own contract with `deposit` and `withdraw` functionalities based on the provided base contract.
2. Deploy it to Scroll Sepolia testnet.
3. And finally verify it.
 
If you need help with using a smart contract framework for completing this challenge, the [Level Up: Build with Foundry](https://www.levelup.xyz/content/level-up-foundry) guide might be a helpful start!

## What You'll Need to Know

### Core Functions in Aave: Supply, Withdraw, Borrow, and Repay

These are the four core functions in the Aave protocol:

- **Supply:** Lend tokens by depositing them into the Aave Pool.
- **Withdraw:** Retrieve your supplied tokens along with any earned rewards.
- **Borrow:** Borrow tokens from the pool.
- **Repay:** Pay back the borrowed tokens plus interest.

In this challenge, we will focus on the `supply` and `withdraw` functions.

### ATokens: Aave's Auto-Yield Tokens

When you `supply` tokens to Aave, you receive ATokens as a receipt. For example, if you deposit `10 DAI` into the Aave Pool, you will get `10 aDAI` in return. This token tracks how much you supplied and the yield you've earned, so when you `withdraw`, you receive your tokens along with any accrued rewards.

For instance, if you deposit `10 DAI` today, you immediately receive `10 aDAI`. After several blocks, your `10 aDAI` might become `11 aDAI`. When you `withdraw`, you return your `11 aDAI` and receive `11 DAI`, earning a `1 DAI` profit.

ATokens use rebase functionality, making it easy for users to track their earnings without manual interaction.

### What is a Rebase Token?

Rebase tokens, like ATokens, fully comply with the ERC20 standard but with a twist. They include a mechanism that adjusts all holders' balances proportionally based on a variable called `RATE`.

Typically, the `balanceOf()` function in ERC20 looks like this:

```solidity
balanceOf(x) = balances[x]
```

In rebase tokens, the `RATE` variable modifies this:

```solidity
balanceOf(x) = sharesOf(x) * RATE
```

Here:
- `sharesOf(x)` also called "fragments", represents the amount of tokens a holder has in proportion to the rest.
- `RATE` is a variable that adjusts to distribute rewards evenly across all holders.

This allows the protocol to efficiently distribute rewards, and users can simply check their AToken balance to see how much they've earned without needing to interact further.

## Understanding Aave Functions in This Challenge

### The `supply()` Function

In this challenge, the `deposit` function in your smart contract will call the `supply` function to deposit `DAI` into the Aave pool. In return, the user will receive an equivalent amount of `aDAI`.

```solidity
function supply(
  address asset,
  uint256 amount,
  address onBehalfOf,
  uint16 referralCode
) external;
```

- **asset:** The token being deposited into the pool (we’ll use DAI in this challenge).
- **amount:** The amount of the `asset` being deposited, in wei.
- **onBehalfOf:** The address that will receive the ATokens.
- **referralCode:** A code for third-party integrations. For this challenge, set it to 0.

### The `withdraw()` Function

The `withdraw` function will transfer the user's `aDAI` back to the Aave pool, allowing them to receive their `DAI` along with any earned interest.

```solidity
function withdraw(
  address asset,
  uint256 amount,
  address to
) external returns (uint256);
```

- **asset:** The underlying asset being withdrawn from the pool (in this case, DAI, not the AToken).
- **amount:** The amount of the `asset` being withdrawn, in wei.
- **to:** The address that will receive the tokens.

### Retrieving the AToken Address with `getReserveData()`

Each ERC20 token supported by Aave has a corresponding AToken. You can find the address of the AToken by calling the `getReserveData()` function, which returns the aTokenAddress along with other details about the token pool. You'll need this address to manage funds in the withdraw function.

```solidity
ISwapRouter.ExactInputSingleParamsIPool(AAVE_POOL_ADDRESS)
  .getReserveData(STAKED_TOKEN_ADDRESS)
  .aTokenAddress;
```

This will provide the AToken address, which is required for interacting with the Aave Pool.

## A Cool Tip

* Did you know that the [Official Aave testnet UI](https://staging.aave.com/) supports Scroll Sepolia? After supplying tokens you will be able to see your position in the UI. Also, you can mint testnet DAI on [The Aave faucet](https://staging.aave.com/faucet/) in order to test your code.

## Step by step: How to complete this challenge

1. **Implement the deposit function:**
    - Transfer the DAI tokens to this contract.
    - Approve the Aave Pool contract to manage the deposited DAI.
    - Call the `supply()` function on behalf of the transaction sender.

2. **Implement the withdraw function:**
    - Transfer the aDAI tokens (the AToken) for withdrawal.
    - Approve the Aave Pool contract to manage the aDAI.
    - Call the `withdraw()` function to receive DAI back.

## Test it yourself

To ensure your implementation works, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repo and navigate to the directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Turupawn/LendingChallengeLevelUp.git
cd LendingChallengeLevelUp
```

2. Complete the functions in `src/AaveLender.sol`

3. Run the tests on Scroll Sepolia:

```
forge test --fork-url https://scroll-testnet-public.unifra.io
```
