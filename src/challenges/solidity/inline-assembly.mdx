summary: Introduction to Inline Assembly in Solidity and its use for low-level control over the EVM
labels: ["solidity"]
---

Inline Assembly in Solidity allows developers to write low-level code directly within Solidity contracts. It provides fine-grained control over the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and enables developers to perform operations that are not directly available through Solidity's high-level constructs. Inline Assembly is written using the `assembly` keyword followed by a block of assembly code.

## Purpose of Inline Assembly

Inline Assembly is primarily used for:

- **Optimization**: To reduce gas costs by implementing more efficient low-level operations.
- **Access to EVM Internals**: Direct access to low-level features and instructions that are not available in high-level Solidity.
- **Compatibility**: Interacting with legacy smart contracts or performing operations not directly supported by Solidity.
- 
## Dangerous Aspects of Inline Assembly

Inline Assembly is a powerful feature in Solidity, but it comes with certain risks and limitations:
- **Complexity**: Assembly code is more complex and harder to read than high-level Solidity code.
- **Security Risks**: Incorrectly written assembly code can lead to vulnerabilities and security risks.
- **Portability**: Assembly code may not be portable across different EVM versions or compilers.

## Example of Inline Assembly

Here is an example illustrating the use of inline assembly in Solidity to perform arithmetic operations:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.26;

contract AssemblyExample {
    // Function to add two numbers using inline assembly
    function add(uint256 a, uint256 b) public pure returns (uint256 result) {
        assembly {
            result := add(a, b)
        }
    }

    // Function to save data to the contract storage using inline assembly
    function setStorageData(uint256 slot, uint256 data) public {
        assembly {
            sstore(slot, data)
        }
    }

    // Function to get stored data from the contract storage
    // returns the value stored at the specified slot
    function getStorageData(
        uint256 slot
    ) public view returns (uint256 data) {
        assembly {
            data := sload(slot)
        }
    }
}
