# Data Types

Solidity is a statically typed language, which means that the type of each variable (state and local) needs to be specified. Solidity provides several elementary types such as:

- `bool` (boolean)
- `uint`,`uint256`,`uint32` (unsigned integer)
- `int`,`int256`,`int32` (signed integer)
- `address` (Ethereum address)

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.24;

contract Primitives {
    bool public boo = true;

    /*
    uint stands for unsigned integer, meaning non negative integers
    different sizes are available
        uint8   ranges from 0 to 2 ** 8 - 1
        uint16  ranges from 0 to 2 ** 16 - 1
        ...
        uint256 ranges from 0 to 2 ** 256 - 1
    */uint8 public u8 = 1;
    uint256 public u256 = 456;
    uint256 public u = 123; // uint is an alias for uint256/*
    Negative numbers are allowed for int types.
    Like uint, different ranges are available from int8 to int256

    int256 ranges from -2 ** 255 to 2 ** 255 - 1
    int128 ranges from -2 ** 127 to 2 ** 127 - 1
    */int8 public i8 = -1;
    int256 public i256 = 456;
    int256 public i = -123; // int is same as int256// minimum and maximum of intint256 public minInt = type(int256).min;
    int256 public maxInt = type(int256).max;

    address public addr = 0xCA35b7d915458EF540aDe6068dFe2F44E8fa733c;
}
```

## Bytes in Solidity

In Solidity, the `bytes` data type is used to represent a sequence of bytes. Bytes are useful for storing binary data, such as file contents or cryptographic hashes.

There are two types of byte arrays in Solidity:

- **Fixed-size byte arrays**: These are declared with `bytes1` to `bytes32`. The number indicates the length of the array in bytes. For example, `bytes1` is a byte array of length 1, `bytes2` is a byte array of length 2, and so on up to `bytes32`.

- **Dynamically-sized byte arrays**: These are declared with `bytes`. This type is similar to `byte[]` in other languages.

Here's an example of how to use byte arrays:

```solidity
// Declare a fixed-size byte array
bytes1 a = 0xb5; // [10110101]
bytes1 b = 0x56; // [01010110]

// Declare a bytes10 array
bytes10 d = 0x68656c6c6f776f726c64; // "helloworld" in hexadecimal

// Declare a bytes32 array
bytes32 e = 0x68656c6c6f776f726c6420202020202020202020202020202020202020202020; // "helloworld" padded with spaces in hexadecimal

// Declare a dynamically-sized byte array
bytes memory c = "Hello, world!";
```
