# Operator

Operators link variables, statements and functions together. In Solidity, arithmetic and bit operators can be applied even if two operands do not have same type.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT*pragma solidity ^0.8.24;

contract Operator {

    uint8 public constant x = 1;
    uint32 public constant y = 4;
    //x + y = 5;
}
```

Ternary operator is used in expressions of the form `<conditional> ? <if-true> : <if-false>`. It evaluates if `<conditional>` is truthy or falsy.

Compound and increment/decrement operators are available as shorthands. For example, `a += e` is equivalent to `a = a + e` .

Other examples:

- `a++` (equivalent to `a += 1` )
- `a--` (equivalent to `a -= 1` )

`*=` Multiplication assignment operator:

```solidity
uint32 a = 5; // a is 5
a *= 2; // a is now 10 (5 * 2)
```

In this example, `a *= 2` is equivalent to `a = a * 2`. The `*=` operator multiplies the value of `a` by `2` and then assigns the result back to `a`.

`<<=` Left shift assignment operator:

```solidity
uint32 b = 4; // b is 4 (binary representation: 100)
b <<= 2; // b is now 16 (binary representation: 10000)
```

In this example, `b <<= 2` is equivalent to `b = b << 2`. The `<<=` operator shifts the bits of `b` two places to the left. Each shift to the left doubles the number, so shifting `4` (which is `100` in binary) two places to the left results in `16` (which is `10000` in binary).

`>>=` Right shift assignment operator

```solidity
uint32 c = 16; // c is 16 (binary representation: 10000)
c >>= 2; // c is now 4 (binary representation: 100)
```

In this example, `c >>= 2` is equivalent to `c = c >> 2`. The `>>=` operator shifts the bits of `c` two places to the right. Each shift to the right halves the number, so shifting `16` (which is `10000` in binary) two places to the right results in `4` (which is `100` in binary).
