# Constants

Constants are variables that cannot be modified. Constants should be named with all capital letters with underscores separating words. Examples: `MAX_BLOCKS`, `TOKEN_NAME`, `TOKEN_TICKER`, `CONTRACT_VERSION`.

Their value is hard coded and using constants can save gas cost.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MITpragma solidity ^0.8.24;

contract Constants {
    // coding convention to uppercase constant variablesaddress public constant MY_ADDRESS =
        0x777788889999AaAAbBbbCcccddDdeeeEfFFfCcCc;
    uint256 public constant MY_UINT = 123;
}
```
