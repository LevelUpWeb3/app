### Who is this contest for?

Web3 developers of all levels—beginner, intermediate, and advanced—who are passionate about learning and sharing their knowledge about the latest on Ethereum. The focus areas include applied ZK, scalability, different evm languages and well known Ethereum protocols.

### Contest Rules

1. **Pick a topic** from the Article Topic Board down below. Each topic includes detailed expectations and a corresponding bounty for the article.
2. **Choose up to three topics** from the board. Every participant can submit up to three articles of their choice, only one winner will be selected per topic.
3. **Optional**: Share what you're working on via our [Telegram group]((https://t.me/+0tvdw8QMJBMyOTli)).
