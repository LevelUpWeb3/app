title: Hackathon Overview

Test and level up your skills in this one-week online hackathon brought together by [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/) and [Scroll](https://scroll.io/)! All you need to do is deploy a contract on Scroll and [leverage the Alchemy RPC via the Scroll API](https://docs.alchemy.com/reference/scroll-chain-api-quickstart).

Forget product market fit, we're looking for your most creative, silly, moonshot ideas. Dream up the impossible, the ridiculous, the absolutely out-of-this-world projects and just build.

Here's to celebrating all you crazy, giga-brained developers ðŸ¥³

<strong>Dates</strong>
- Sept 24th to Sept 30th (submissions due September 30th, 5PM UTC)
