# ERC20 Basics

If you haven't completed the Simple Token Swap challenge yet, check it out [here](https://www.levelup.xyz/challenges/simple-token-swap)! 

Most of you are probably familiar with tokens like WETH, USDT, USDC, and many others. Did you know that all of these tokens are designed by following the ERC20 standard?

In this challenge, you will implement a basic ERC20 token contract that includes minting, burning, transferring, and approving functionalities.

## Objective

Your task is to:
1. Develop your own ERC20 token.
2. Deploy it to Scroll Sepolia Testnet.
3. And finally verify it.
 
If you need help with using a smart contract framework for completing this challenge, the [Level Up: Build with Foundry](https://www.levelup.xyz/content/level-up-foundry) guide might be a helpful start!

If you get stuck, feel free to ask for help in [Level Up Telegram group](https://t.me/+PdNbk5milo1mMTAy).

    // Function to burn tokens from a specified address
    function burn(address from, uint256 amount) public {

    function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) public override returns (bool) {

    function approve(address spender, uint256 amount) public override returns (bool) {
        // Implement the approve function using the _approve internal function
    }

    // Function to transfer tokens from one address to another using an allowance
    function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 amount) public override returns (bool) {
        // Implement the transferFrom function using the _transfer and _approve internal functions
    }

        // Implement the getBalanceOf function

## Instructions

1. **Constructor:** The constructor should initialize the ERC20 token by minting the `initialSupply` to the deployer's address. Use the `_mint` function provided by the ERC20 contract.

2. **Mint Function:** Implement the `mint` function, which should allow you to create new tokens and assign them to a specific address. This function should call the `_mint` function provided by the ERC20 contract.

3. **Burn Function:** Implement the `burn` function, which should allow you to destroy tokens from a specific address, reducing the total supply. Use the `_burn` function provided by the ERC20 contract.

4. **Transfer Function:** Implement the `transfer` function to allow the caller to send tokens to another address. Override the `transfer` function and use the `_transfer` function from the ERC20 contract.

5. **Approve Function:** Implement the `approve` function, allowing the caller to authorize another address to spend a certain amount of tokens on their behalf. Override the `approve` function and use the `_approve` function from the ERC20 contract.

6. **TransferFrom Function:** Implement the `transferFrom` function to allow a spender to transfer tokens from one address to another, using an allowance set by the `approve` function. Override the `transferFrom` function and use the `_transfer` and `_approve` functions to implement this functionality.
