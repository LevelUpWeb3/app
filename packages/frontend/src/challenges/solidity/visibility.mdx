# Visibility

Solidity knows two kinds of function calls: external and internal ones. Internal functions can be made inaccessible to derived contracts. This gives rise to four types of visibility for functions.

`external`
External functions are part of the contract interface, which means they can be called from other contracts and via transactions. An external function f cannot be called internally (i.e. f() does not work, but this.f() works).

`public`
Public functions are part of the contract interface and can be either called internally or via message calls.

`internal`
Internal functions can only be accessed from within the current contract or contracts deriving from it. They cannot be accessed externally.Can take parameters of internal types like mappings or storage references.

`private`
Private functions are like internal ones but they are not visible in derived contracts.

contract BaseContract {
    // External function
    // Can be called from other contracts and via transactions
    // Cannot be called internally
    function externalFunc() external pure returns (string memory) {
        return "External function called";
    }

    // Public function
    // Can be called internally or via message calls
    function publicFunc() public pure returns (string memory) {
        return "Public function called";
    }

    // Internal function
    // Can only be accessed from within the current contract or contracts deriving from it
    // Cannot be accessed externally
    function internalFunc() internal pure returns (string memory) {
        return "Internal function called";
    }

    // Private function
    // Can only be accessed from within the current contract
    // Cannot be accessed from derived contracts or externally
    function privateFunc() private pure returns (string memory) {
        return "Private function called";
    }

    function testFuncs() public view returns (string memory, string memory) {
        // Call the public and internal functions
        // Call the external function using "this"
        return (publicFunc(), this.externalFunc());
    }
}

contract DerivedContract is BaseContract {
    function callBaseFuncs() public view returns (string memory, string memory) {
        // Can call the public and internal functions of the base contract
        return (publicFunc(), internalFunc());
    }
}
```
