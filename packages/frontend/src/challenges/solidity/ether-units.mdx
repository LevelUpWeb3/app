# Ether Units

Ether is the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain. It is used to pay for transaction fees and computational services on the network.

Ether is divisible into smaller units, with the smallest unit being a `wei`.

A literal number can take a suffix of `wei`, `gwei` or `ether` to specify a subdenomination of Ether. Ether numbers without a postfix (`wei`, `gwei`, `ether`) are assumed to be `wei`.

    uint256 public oneWei = 1 wei;
    // 1 wei is equal to 1
    bool public isOneWei = 1 wei == 1;

    unit256 public oneGwei = 1 gwei;
    // 1 gwei is equal to 1e9 wei
    bool public isOneGwei = 1 gwei == 1e9;

    uint256 public oneEther = 1 ether;
    // 1 ether is equal to 10^18 wei
    bool public isOneEther = 1 ether == 1e18;
}
```
