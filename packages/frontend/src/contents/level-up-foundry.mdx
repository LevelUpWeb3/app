In Level Up, this Foundry module is designed to reduce friction by immediately equipping you with fundamental skills to develop smart contracts on Scroll Sepolia.

In order to facilitate this process, we have curated a simplified structure to help you get started with Foundry on Scroll Sepolia.

If you are feeling adventurous, jump into your code editor and follow along!

## Introduction

**What is Foundry?**

[Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) is a blazingly fast, portable and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development written in Rust.

**Why Foundry?**

- Write all your code ONLY in Solidity (i.e. scripts, tests, all in Solidity)!
- Speedrun your developer journey without having to learn multiple languages.

## How Foundry?

Glad you asked ðŸ”¥.

Let's dive right in!

## [0]: Install Foundry

Foundry is installed using Foundryup.

<ContentCopy
  code={`curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash`}
  language="bash"
/>

Source your `.zshenv` file to ensure the path is updated.

<ContentCopy code={`source /Users/your_username/.zshenv`} language="bash" />

To verify the installation, run the following command:

<ContentCopy
  code={`forge --version
// forge 0.x.x ...
cast --version
// cast 0.x.x ...`}
  language="bash"
/>

Additional resource from Foundry Book specific to [installation](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation)

## [1]: Create a Foundry Project

Create a new project and navigate into it.

<ContentCopy
  code={`mkdir foundry-project
cd foundry-project`}
  language="bash"
/>

Run `forge init` in your terminal to create a new Foundry project.

<ContentCopy code={`$foundry-project forge init`} language="bash" />

## [2]: Compiling a Foundry Project

In this example, we will use a simple EtherWallet example below:

<ContentCopy code={`// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.24;

contract EtherWallet {
address payable public owner;

    constructor() {
        owner = payable(msg.sender);
    }

    receive() external payable {}

    function withdraw(uint _amount) external {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "caller is not owner");
        payable(msg.sender).transfer(_amount);
    }

    function getBalance() external view returns (uint) {
        return address(this).balance;
    }

}`} language="solidity"/>

Rename `Contract.sol` in `src/Contract.sol` to `EtherWallet.sol`.

Delete `src/test` folder. We will not be using it in this Speedrun lesson.

Run `forge build` to compile the contract:

<ContentCopy
  code={`$foundry-project forge build
`}
  language="bash"
/>

Navigate to the `out` folder and you will see the compiled contract `EtherWallet.json`.

## [3]: Deploying on anvil

Anvil is a local testnet node shipped with Foundry.

Run `anvil` in your terminal.

<ContentCopy
  code={`$foundry-project anvil
`}
  language="bash"
/>

This command spins up a local server hosted on http://localhost:8545 that runs the test network. (Server URL can vary depending on user environment)

To deploy on anvil, run:

<ContentCopy
  code={`// $foundry-project forge create <NAME CONTRACT> --rpc-url <LOCALHOST> --interactive
forge create EtherWallet --rpc-url http://localhost:8545 --interactive
`}
  language="bash"
/>

You will be prompted to enter your private key. Go into the anvil terminal, then copy any private key from the terminal.

Paste it in the terminal where you are deploying the contract.

<ContentCopy
  code={`// $foundry-project forge create <NAME CONTRACT> --rpc-url <LOCALHOST> --interactive
forge create EtherWallet --rpc-url http://localhost:8545 --interactive
// paste anvil private key
`}
  language="bash"
/>

After running the command, you should see an output similar to this:

<ContentCopy
  code={`Deployer: 0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266
Deployed to: 0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3
Transaction hash: 0x4b1d82d3d33674496088b5e92e99494280ffcc1f27035269873a5ca04c432c93
`}
  language="bash"
/>

## [4]: Deploying with Script

Foundry allows you to deploy smart contracts by running a script. Scripts are recognisable through the `s.sol` extension and stored in `/scripts` folder.

This is what a script example named `DeployEtherWallet.s.sol` would look like:

<ContentCopy code={`// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.24;

import { Script, console2 } from "forge-std/Script.sol";
import { EtherWallet } from "../src/EtherWallet.sol";

contract EtherWalletScript is Script {
function run() external returns (EtherWallet) {
vm.startBroadcast();

       EtherWallet etherWallet = new EtherWallet();

       vm.stopBroadcast();
       return etherWallet;

}
}
`} language="solidity"/>

Use `anvil` to simulate onchain transactions.

<ContentCopy
  code={`$foundry-project forge script script/DeployEtherWallet.s.sol --rpc-url http://localhost:8545 --broadcast
`}
  language="bash"
/>

Forge simulates the script and `â€”broadcast` flag was added to broadcast the transaction.

## [5]: Setting up Deployment Environment

There are two ways to do this in Foundry. One is the traditional way of using a `.env` file and the other is by using Foundry tools. Patrick Collins did an amazing job explaining it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQe7cIpaE54)!

We'll start off with explaining the awesome way using Foundry!

### Using Foundry Tools

Open your local machine terminal and run:

<ContentCopy
  code={`// cast wallet import <ACCOUNT_NAME> --interactive
cast wallet import defaultKey --interactive
`}
  language="bash"
/>

You will be prompted to enter your private key and a password to secure `<ACCOUNT_NAME>`.

REMINDER: We recommend to pass your private key and a password on your computer's terminal and NOT the code editor.

For additional security measures:

Leveled up security - Delete your history by running the following command:

<ContentCopy
  code={`history -c
`}
  language="bash"
/>

Godlike security - Run `rm <TERMINAL_HISTORY>` to delete your terminal history!

<ContentCopy
  code={`rm .bash_history
// or rm .zsh_history if you use zsh shell
`}
  language="bash"
/>

Finally, run the command below to see the list of all accounts available:

<ContentCopy
  code={`cast wallet list
`}
  language="bash"
/>

### Using `.env` File

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project.

<ContentCopy
  code={`$foundry-project touch .env
`}
  language="bash"
/>

File contents would look like this:

<ContentCopy
  code={`PRIVATE_KEY=0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef
RPC_URL=http://localhost:8545
`}
  language="bash"
/>

Load `.env` file in foundry by running:

<ContentCopy
  code={`$foundry-project source .env
`}
  language="bash"
/>

To deploy a contract, you can now run:

<ContentCopy
  code={`$foundry-project forge script script/DeployEtherWallet.s.sol --rpc-url $RPC_URL --broadcast --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY
`}
  language="bash"
/>

REMINDER: You should **NEVER** place a private key or a secret phrase in a `.env` file that is associated with real funds! This is a HUGE security risk. (If you have not taken the .env pledge, do it [NOW](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/full-blockchain-solidity-course-js/discussions/5)!)

## [6]: Deploy on Scroll Sepolia Network

### Setting up Scroll Sepolia Network & Testnet Funds

We're almost there to deployment!

First let's add the Scroll network to your metamask.

Head over to [Scroll Sepolia](https://sepolia.scroll.io/portal) and add Scroll Sepolia testnet to your wallet.

Note: Check out this quick [video on X](https://twitter.com/BuildWithScroll/status/1714789104129581454) if you prefer adding Scroll Sepolia via [Chainlist](https://chainlist.org/chain/534351)

Now that we've added the network to our MetaMask, [click here](https://t.me/+PdNbk5milo1mMTAy) to join Level Up Telegram group for Scroll Sepolia ETH or visit the faucet links in [Scroll's Faucet documentation](https://docs.scroll.io/en/user-guide/faucet/).

If you run into issues with testnet eth, please let us know in the Level Up Telegram group.

### Deploying to Scroll Sepolia

Contract deployment uses `forge create` command.

<ContentCopy
  code={`$foundry-project forge create <CONTRACT_NAME> --rpc-url <NETWORK> --account <ACCOUNT_NAME>
`}
  language="bash"
/>

In this case, the command will look like this:

<ContentCopy
  code={`$foundry-project forge create EtherWallet --rpc-url https://sepolia-rpc.scroll.io/ --account defaultKey --broadcast
// optional: add -vvv for verbose output (add v's as needed to increase verbosity)
`}
  language="bash"
/>

Enter your password and voila! Your contract is deployed on Scroll Sepolia!

If you are updating the `RPC_URL` in `.env`, remember to run `source .env` to reload the environment variable changes.

## [7]: Contract Verification

Verifying your contract makes your contract readable on a block explorer like Etherscan or **[Scrollscan](https://sepolia.scrollscan.com/)**. This also provides a user interface for contract interaction.

You will first need API keys to verify your contract via Foundry. Here's how to do this:

1. Create an account at https://scrollscan.com/register
2. Get API Keys from your account

Here's an explainer [video](https://youtu.be/ks9Cj-lP1Tw?t=360) if you are stuck.

Update your `.env` file to include two new variables:

1. VERIFIER_URL
2. SCROLLSCAN_API_KEY

Reload the environment variables by running `source .env`.

The command structure for verifying contract is as follows:

<ContentCopy
  code={`forge verify-contract <CONTRACT_ADDRESS> <CONTRACT_NAME>
  --verifier-url <BLOCK_EXPLORER_URL> \
  --etherscan-api-key <SCROLLSCAN_API_KEY> \
  --constructor-args <CONSTRUCTOR_ARGUMENTS> //if any`}
  language="bash"
/>

This is an example of my command with a random contract address:

<ContentCopy
  code={`forge verify-contract 0x998608B4f83249c4217ADb9060Fb739d4A52C6A2 EtherWallet
  --verifier-url $VERIFIER_URL \
  --etherscan-api-key $SCROLLSCAN_API_KEY \
`}
  language="bash"
/>

## [8]: Contract Interaction

You can interact with your smart contract by using the `cast` command.

Here is the general structure to using `cast`:

<ContentCopy
  code={`cast [options] <CONTRACT_FUNCTION> [args]
`}
  language="bash"
/>

While there are many [options](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/cast/cast?highlight=cast#cast) available to interact with contracts, we focus on the two common options: `call` and `send`.

### `call`

To retrieve data from the contract in the blockchain:

<ContentCopy
  code={`// Get the balance of the contract
$foundry-project cast call 0x998608B4f83249c4217ADb9060Fb739d4A52C6A2 "getBalance()" --rpc-url $RPC_URL
`}
  language="bash"
/>

NOTE: Private key does not need to be passed in `call` command as it does not require any transaction to be sent.

### `send`

To execute function in the contract:

<ContentCopy
  code={`// Send 0.1 Ether to the contract
$foundry-project cast send 0x998608B4f83249c4217ADb9060Fb739d4A52C6A2 --value 100000000000000000 --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY --rpc-url $RPC_URL
`}
  language="bash"
/>

<ContentCopy
  code={`// Withdraw 0.000099999999999999 Ether
$foundry-project cast send 0x998608B4f83249c4217ADb9060Fb739d4A52C6A2 "withdraw(uint)" 99999999999999990 --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY --rpc-url $RPC_URL
`}
  language="bash"
/>
