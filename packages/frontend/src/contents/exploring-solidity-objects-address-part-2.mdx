In [Part 1](https://rhbdl.substack.com/p/exploring-solidity-objects-address?r=1v972g), we explored different `address` members and their use cases. While the previous article explored scenarios involving sending Ether, it is helpful to know that the functionalities extend beyond that.

For instance, the `call` function is a low-level function which has the capability to invoke any function on any target contract by specifying the function signature and arguments in the "data" parameter. **(Security Note: call never reverts. It is our responsibility to handle unsuccessful transaction errors.)**

Now, let's delve into the final two members of the address object: `staticcall` and `delegatecall`. These members are also interchangeably referred as functions - particularly when describing their role in code execution through invocation.

The underlying concept of `staticcall` and `delegatecall` is relatively straightforward, as they are essentially specialized variants of the `call` function.

## **1. delegatecall**

This function allows state modifying instructions while preserving the original contract's context (storage, sender address, and value).

At this point, you might be wondering about the terminology “delegatecall”. How exactly are the function calls “delegated”? Or rather, what is the mode of “delegation” here?

Let's utilise the code below to answer these questions!

<ContentCopy code={`pragma solidity ^0.8.24;

contract Caller {
uint256 public value;

    function setVars(uint256 _value) public payable {
        value = _value;
    }

}

contract DelegateCaller {
uint256 public value;

    function setVars(address _callerContract, uint256 _value) public payable {
        // Caller delegated its setVars() function to DelegateCaller Contract
        (bool success, ) = _callerContract.delegatecall(
            abi.encodeWithSignature("setVars(uint256)", _value)
        );
        if (!success) revert("Failed");
    }

}`} language="solidity"/>

When `setVars()` is called in DelegateCaller contract, the `delegatecall` invokes the `setVars()` function in the Caller contract but in the DelegateCaller execution environment.

Thus, Caller contract has effectively delegated its function to DelegateCaller contract.

Let's explore further using the video below! (**Watch what happens when `setVars()` was called in DelegateCaller contract.** Observe how the `value` variables change in the context of Caller and DelegateCaller contract.)

_Were you able to identify the contract that had its `value` variable updated when `delegatecall` was invoked?_

This behavior might seem redundant at first when we can simply use `call` function. However, `delegatecall` enables use cases such as for proxy contracts - where only the implementation contract (i.e. Uniswap V2, V3) is upgraded to preserve the context of the proxy contract.

Having explored the complexities of `delegatecall`, let’s proceed to explore `staticcall` which is relatively simpler!

## **2. staticcall**

In general, `staticcall` does not allow any state modifying instructions or capability to send ether. It will revert if there are any state changes during the function invocation.

At a low-level, it disallows opcodes such as CREATE, SSTORE, SELFDESTRUCT, and few [others](https://www.evm.codes/#fa?fork=cancun). Personally, I view `staticcall` as a safer variant of the call function to read state.

</div>

In the example above, notice how the `value` variable for StaticCaller contract did not change. It remains as “0” even when Caller contract has been updated to store “100” in its `value` variable. Unlike `delegatecall` which allows state modifying instruction, `staticcall` only reads state of the target contract (Caller contract in this example).

As a treat, I have also included a function `setVars()` which purposefully calls a state modifying function from the target contract to simulate transaction failure. Watch the video towards the end to learn what happens when `success` returns false.

In [ETH CC Brussels](https://ethglobal.com/events/brussels/prizes/scroll), Scroll introduced the experimental [L1SLOAD precompile](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/rip-7728-l1sload-precompile/20388) which uses `staticcall` under the hood.

Hackers were able to explore novel methods of resolving ENS address, extending NFT ownership - all on L2. Despite preliminary stage of experimentation, this highlights that the potential opportunities for this function are virtually limitless.

Now that you have equipped yourself with an arsenal of knowledge on the `address` object, you are now capable of address-ing (Hehe! Pun intended) more intermediate to advanced level builds. Can't wait to hear all about how you will be using this knowledge to level up your projects.
