## What is this Mission About?

The summary outlines a progressive learning journey in developing smart contracts for decentralized finance (DeFi), starting from the basics of handling Ethereum transactions, including deposits, withdrawals, and borrowing in Level 1. As learners progress, they delve into handling ERC20 tokens, introduce collateral-based borrowing, and eventually develop advanced collateral management and liquidation strategies, culminating in building a full-featured DeFi lending platform by Level 5. Each level escalates in complexity, from basic transactions to crafting a financial masterpiece that prepares one to be a frontrunner in the blockchain revolution.

## Key Features of the Mission

Level 1: Basic Lending and Borrowing Contract 🚀
Kick off your smart contract journey by understanding the basics: wax on, wax off! In Level 1, you're diving headfirst into Ethereum's world, creating a contract about the basics: depositing, withdrawing, and borrowing ETH. It's your first step in mastering the blockchain arena, where every line of code counts.

Level 2: Introducing ERC20 Token Handling 🌌
Elevate your game in Level 2 by tackling the universe of ERC20 tokens. This level is all about adaptation and expansion – you'll modify your contract to handle these popular tokens, learning the ropes of real-world crypto transactions. It's your gateway to understanding the vast landscape of digital assets.

Level 3: Borrowing Against Collateral 💪
Get ready to level up in Level 3! Here, you'll bring collateral into the mix, adding a layer of complexity to your contract. This is where you start playing with the big guns, introducing collateral-based borrowing and planting your feet firmly in the world of risk and reward.

Level 4: Advanced Collateral and Liquidation Mechanics 🌟
It's time to push the boundaries in Level 4. Here, you'll weave advanced collateral management and liquidation strategies into your contract. This level is about fine-tuning your skills and diving deep into the mechanics that make DeFi tick. You're not just building a contract; you're crafting a financial masterpiece.

Level 5: Full-Featured DeFi Contract 🏆
Reach the pinnacle of your smart contract journey in Level 5. This is where you put it all together, building a DeFi lending platform that's robust, complex, and ready for the real world. You'll integrate everything you've learned, proving that you're not just a participant in the blockchain revolution – you're a frontrunner.
